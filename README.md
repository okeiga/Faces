# Python Programs for Functions and Variables

This repository contains a collection of Python programs demonstrating basic input and output handling, string manipulation, and simple mathematical calculations. Each program adheres to specific requirements.


## Programs
### 1. Playback.py

Prompts the user for input and outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (three periods).

### 2. Faces.py

Contains two functions:

convert(s: str) -> str: Replaces occurrences of :) with ðŸ˜Š and :( with ðŸ˜ž. All other text is returned unchanged.
main(): Prompts the user for input, calls convert, and prints the result.
einstein.py
Prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and outputs the equivalent energy in Joules, based on Einsteinâ€™s mass-energy equivalence formula.

### 3. Tip.py

Includes two functions:

dollars_to_float(dollar_str: str) -> float: Removes the leading $ from a string formatted as $##.## and returns the amount as a float.
percent_to_float(percent_str: str) -> float: Removes the trailing % from a string formatted as ##% and returns the percentage as a float.
## Usage

To run any of these programs, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where the program is located, and execute the program using the command:

bash
Copy code
python filename.py
Replace filename.py with the name of the specific program you want to run.
